# C-Numericals

This repository contains solved numerical problems based on **C programming concepts**.  
All problems are written in **C language** with clear explanations provided as comments inside the source files.

## Topics Covered
- Structure memory calculation
- Array and 2D array memory calculation
- Address calculation (row-major order)
- Union memory and behavior
- Structure vs Union comparison
- Enum usage and behavior
- Combination of enum, union, structure, and arrays

## File Structure
Each numerical problem is stored in a **separate `.c` file** for clarity and easy understanding.

Example:
- `student_structure.c`
- `matrix_memory.c`
- `union_memory.c`
- `structure_vs_union.c`
- `enum_union_structure.c`
- `employee_record.c`

## Assumptions Used
Unless stated otherwise:
- `int` = 4 bytes  
- `float` = 4 bytes  
- `char` = 1 byte  
- `enum` = 4 bytes  
- Padding and alignment are ignored  
- Row-major order is assumed for arrays

## Purpose
This repository is created for:
- Academic practice
- Exam preparation
- Understanding memory lay
